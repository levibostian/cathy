# cathy

npm module to make comments on GitHub pull requests.

# Goals of this project

- Minimal dependencies. This module is meant to be a dependency of your projects like GitHub Actions. Be small for quick install and security reasons.
- Typescript and Javascript support with officially supported Typescript bindings.

# Getting started

- Install module in project:

```
npm install --save cathy
```

- Authenticate with GitHub and make a comment!

```ts
import cathy from "cathy"

cathy.speak("### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! ðŸ‘‹", {
  // **Required** options parameters
  //
  // Personal access token for GitHub account you want to make comment for.
  // Create token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  githubToken: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  // GitHub repository that we want to make the comment for.
  githubRepo: "username/repo",
  // Issue/pull request number to comment on.
  githubIssue: 12,

  // **Optional** parameters
  // Update existing comment you have sent on this pull request
  updateExisting: false,
  // Identifier used for updating a comment. Cathy updates the existing comment with the provided ID.
  // You only want to change this value if you are trying to use cathy to send multiple unique comments.
  // Example: You use cathy on pull requests to print the status of test coverage *and* a website preview.
  // You would set `updateID` to `testCoverage` and `websitePreview`. If you keep `default` for both,
  // cathy would first comment on a PR for test coverage and then overwrite that comment with the website
  // preview message. Therefore, you would never see the test coverage menu.
  updateID: "default"
})
```

# Contributing

## Development setup

- `npm install`
- Write your code.
- Run tests to test your code works.

## Run tests

Tests for this project perform real HTTP requests against the GitHub API. Being a small project that doesn't require constant development, this is ok at this time to do.

This means that in order to run tests on your local development environment, you need to follow these steps:

- Create a personal GitHub access token that the tests will run against that user.
- Create a `.env` file: `cp .env.example .env`
- Modify `.env` with your own access tokens.
- `npm test` to run tests.

# Credits

- Thank you to [this project](https://github.com/marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment) for the inspiration behind this project. I loved the project, but wanted to add the functionality to my own GitHub Actions which was the original inspiration of this project.
